## About

Adam is a bot framework for Discord, built on top of [arikawa](https://github.com/diamondburned). I originally started
working on this because I needed a simple command router with support for localization, but along the way of building
it, it turned into a fully-featured bot framework. You can do everything from a simple `ping` bot to a localized bot
with custom commands.

## Main Features

* 🖥️ Typed (variadic) arguments and flags, as well as out-of-the-box parsing for shellword, and comma-based notations
* 🌍 Support for localization
* 🗒️ Utilities for permission handling, emojis, and awaiting responses and reactions
* ⚡ Error handling with automatic stack trace generation
* 👪 Command grouping through modules
* ⏳ Command throttling/cooldowns
* ✏️ Support for message edits
* 🤝 Middlewares
* 🛑 Powerful access control system
* 🔌 Custom command sources for commands available at runtime
* ✨ Abstracted - Don't like something? Swap it out for a custom implementation

## Getting Started

Have a look at the [example bots](./_examples) or use the official [guide](https://go-adam.gitbook.io/adam/) and get
your first bot up and running!
