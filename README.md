## About

Adam is a bot framework for Discord, built on top of [diamondburned's](https://github.com/diamondburned) library [arikawa](https://github.com/diamondburned).
I originally started working on this because I needed a simple command router with support for localization, but along the way of building it, it turned into a fully-featured bot framework.
You can do everything from a simple `ping` bot to a localized bot with custom commands.

## Main Features

* 🖥️ Typed (variadic) arguments, flags, and out-of-the-box parsing for shellword, and comma-based notations
* 🌍 (optional) support for localization
* 🗒️ Utilities for things like permission handling, emojis, and message and reaction collectors
* ⚡ Error Handling including stack traces
* 👪 Command grouping through modules
* ⏳ Command throttling/cooldowns
* ✏️ Support for message edits
* 🔄 Command overloading through options
* 🤝 Middlewares
* 🛑 Powerful access control system
* 🔌 Custom command sources available at runtime, for things like custom commands
* ✨ Abstracted - Don't like something? Swap it out for a custom implementation

## Getting started
